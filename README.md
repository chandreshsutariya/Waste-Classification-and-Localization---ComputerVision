# Waste Management in Smart Cities

# Waste-Classification-and-Localization---ComputerVision

The task on hand in this project is to find whether the waste is present in the given image or not, and if waste is present, localize it.

For that I have to prepare a model which 
First:classifies the image as - "waste containing image" and "not waste containing image", so it would be a binary classification task,
Second:if the waste is present in the image - localize it

So, the whole project is approached as per these two tasks and so the project code is divided in two task - binary classifcton, localization

Phase-1: Preliminary study of data

Phase-2: Coding

video links are added in respective phase.
